    <p>Student Registration refers to the process through which a studentâ€™s personal and academic details are officially recorded by an educational institution. It is a crucial step in the student's academic journey, allowing them to be enrolled in courses, participate in campus activities, and gain access to the resources and services provided by the institution. The registration process typically involves collecting basic personal information such as the student's name, date of birth, gender, contact details, and academic history. In modern systems, it may also include the selection of courses, payment of tuition fees, and submission of documents such as identification, proof of residency, and medical records. Proper and accurate student registration ensures that each student is recognized by the institution, enabling smooth administration and communication throughout their academic tenure. It also serves as a foundation for maintaining records, tracking academic progress, and ensuring compliance with institutional policies.</p>
